PARVIS — Doctrinal Anchor Library
doctrine.py

Full doctrinal rules, cases, analytical tests, error patterns and key passages
for each of the 19 child nodes in the PARVIS Bayesian network.

This module is the primary reference used by document_analyzer.py when Claude
analyses uploaded legal documents against the PARVIS node schema.

HOW TO UPDATE:
  This file is designed to be maintained as a standalone legal reference.
  When new cases are decided, add them to the relevant node's
  AUTHORITIES or DEVELOPMENTS entries. No changes to any other module
  are required — document_analyzer.py reads this module dynamically.

  Each node entry follows this structure:
    NODE_DOCTRINE[node_id] = {
        "node_name":        str,
        "function":         str,   — what the node represents architecturally
        "primary_auth":     list,  — [{"citation", "para", "principle", "quote"}]
        "analytical_test":  str,   — the legal test the node applies
        "error_patterns":   list,  — recurring judicial errors
        "ewert_caveat":     str,   — Ewert-specific qualification (where applicable)
        "key_principle":    str,   — the core normative principle in one sentence
        "recent_dev":       list,  — recent developments (add as law evolves)
        "update_note":      str,   — flag for areas where law is actively evolving

# ── CITATION METADATA REGISTRY ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Stare decisis layer. For every authority cited in NODE_DOCTRINE, this
# registry records the minimum metadata needed to compute binding force
# relative to a document under analysis:
#
#   court_level  — 'scc' | 'ca' | 'sc' | 'pc' | 'statute' | 'secondary'
#   jurisdiction — 'federal' | 'on' | 'bc' | 'ab' | 'qc' | 'sk' | 'mb'

#   year         — integer (useful for temporal ordering and currency)
#   status       — 'good_law' | 'under_appeal' | 'overruled' | 'distinguished'
#                  | 'inter_provincial_split' | 'unknown'
#   notes        — free text (e.g. known splits, leave applications, caveats)
#
# HOW TO UPDATE: when an authority's status changes (SCC grants leave, a case
# is overruled or distinguished, an inter-provincial split emerges), update
# the 'status' and 'notes' fields here — no change to NODE_DOCTRINE needed.
# The analyzer reads this registry via stare_decisis.py.

# DESIGN NOTE: the registry is keyed by the exact citation string used in
# NODE_DOCTRINE. stare_decisis.normalize_citation() handles minor variations
# ("R v X 2022 ABCA 48" vs "X 2022 ABCA 48"). To add a new authority, add
